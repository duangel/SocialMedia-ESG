# SocialMedia-ESG

PAPER ABSTRACT

Social media has given the masses the ability to comment, at their fingertips, on a
companyâ€™s products, conduct, and environmental footprint within seconds. Understanding
and wielding the impact of this sentiment presents a formidable opportunity. This study
aims to investigate the influence of social media discourse on Environmental, Social, and
Governance (ESG) ratings by analyzing company posts and user comments made on the
Instagram pages of S&P 500 constituents. Natural Language Processing (NLP) models
based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were used
to perform a classification and sentiment analysis task. Studied at the aggregated index
level, no statistically significant relationship was observed between social media sentiments
and changes in ESG measures. The company-level findings suggested that the common
characteristics between companies whose changes in ESG scores were affected by social
media sentiments were: company sector, high social media activity, as measured by the
total number of posts, and high number of Social-classified posts.
